# Dice-Game
Dice game using javascript Document Object Model.
So it's a paint with a h1 with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and Player 2 dice. And when the user refresh the website then two dice get thrown randomly,
so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and website will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.

This  website is deployed on google firebase.
